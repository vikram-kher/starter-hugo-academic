I am a 1st year PhD student in the [Yale Theory Group](https://www.cs.yale.edu/theory/). My research focuses on algorithm design and its interface with problems in economics and social choice. My overarching research goals are to: (1) develop theoretical models of economic and social exchanges that more closely mimic real-life human interactions, (2) create algorithms with robust theoretical guarantees for equitable outcomes.

During my undergrad at USC, I was fortuante to work with Prof. [David Kempe](https://david-kempe.com/) on algorithms for fair committee elections and with Prof. [Assad Oberai](https://sites.usc.edu/oberai/) on using machine learning to predict COVID-19 disease severity. In 2022, I participated in the [DIMACS REU](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/), where I worked with Dr. [Ariel Schvartzman](https://sites.google.com/view/arielsch/home) on topics in auction theory.
